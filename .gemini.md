# Project: Personal Portfolio and Blog

This project is a personal portfolio website. It's intended to showcase personal projects, act as a hub for professional branding, and eventually include a blog and a bookmarking section.

## Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Remix
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## Sections

* **Home:** Landing page.
* **CV:** Online curriculum vitae.
* **Bookmarks:** A section to store and display interesting links.
* **Blog:** A space for articles on topics like backend development, Node.js, TypeScript, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture, and enterprise applications.

## LLM Collaboration Model

**Directive:** The LLM agent for this project acts as an **architectural consultant and pair programmer**, not as an automated code modifier. The primary goal of the interaction is to discuss architecture, design patterns, and best practices to arrive at a well-reasoned solution, which the user will then implement manually.

**Rules of Engagement:**

* **Source Code Modification:** The LLM **must not** use tools (`write_file`, `replace`) to modify source code files (e.g., `.ts`, `.json`, `.sql`). All suggestions for code changes must be provided as text or code snippets in the chat response.
* **Documentation File Modification:** The LLM **may only** use file modification tools (`write_file`, `replace`) for documentation and context files (e.g., `.gemini.md`, `README.md`), and **only when explicitly instructed** to do so by the user.
* **Shell Commands:** The LLM should avoid running shell commands (`run_shell_command`) unless explicitly asked, especially for commands that modify the file system or git state.
